Through the lens of history and photography, *The Experiment of the Tropics* returns to the early twentieth-century Philippines during American occupation and asks, "How does one look at the past?"

By braiding the music of anthropology with the intimacy of the lyric, Lawrence Ypil explores history's archives and excavates a city, both real and imagined, that is constituted by the shimmer of petal and porch, coral and brass &mdash; a river-refrigerator where women catch their reflections on the sheen of magazines and men lean against the walls of old houses and beckon, *come here*. So, we approach.

Spare, musical, and erotic, *The Experiment of the Tropics* uses the intersection of text and image to meditate on the nature of a city and its longing, the revelatory power of photography, and the startling capacity of poetry to cut into the violent but redemptive parts of history.

* Lambda Literary Awards finalist, 2020
* *The Believer* Book Awards longlist, 2020
* Inaugural Gaudy Boy Poetry Book Prize co-winner, 2019
* One of *The Millions*' must-read poetry books, April 2019

**Praise for *Experiment*:**

###### *"A careful investigation of a rich and variegated place."* -Theophilus Kwek, [*Hong Kong Review of Books*](https://hkrbooks.com/2019/05/27/beds-in-the-east-and-the-experiment-of-the-tropics/)

###### *"With their surprising, capricious conceits, these ruminations on place, time, image, and memory bespeak a distinct intelligence and sensibility. Ypil is one of the finest poets from the Philippines today."* - Resil B. Mojares, National Artist of the Philippines for Literature


###### *"Ypil's observant poems are direct and eye-opening...By the time you're done contemplating the truth of an early line, Ypil offers another."* - Nick Ripatrazone, [*The Millions*](https://themillions.com/2019/04/must-read-poetry-april-2019%ef%bb%bf.html)

###### *"\[These poems\] feature the remarkable mind of an exceptional poet who has, against the backdrop of colonial history, brilliantly put into words those covert feelings that complicate our everyday desires and 'disconcert the world.'"* - Mary Jo Bang, author of *The Last Two Seconds*

###### *"\[Ypil is a\] mature writer...One lifts the pages of a family album with the poet, one falls under the spell."* - Wong May, author of *Picasso's Tears*

###### *"What seems far away in time comes closer in Ypil's writing, and the past no longer seems past...While the lines initially seem straightforward and descriptive, they become mysterious as Ypil weaves more and more information into his poems...By bringing together these divergent strands, Ypil is able to something more: he teases out what is erotic in the everyday."* - John Yau, winner of the 2018 Jackson Poetry Prize

###### *"We find ourselves, at the end, with a book that has only revealed a part of its secrets to us. Woken from a dream, we open our eyes to a world that seems a little more beautiful."* - Kendrick Loo, [*Empty Mirror*](https://www.emptymirrorbooks.com/reviews/experiment-tropics-lawrence-lacambra-ypil-review)
