#### *"What Ypil’s poetry ultimately intuits is a kind of life, a persistence of its possibility nevertheless, in a world seemingly already predetermined in all directions. In other words: living, perhaps as a strange way to leave."* - Christian Benitez, [*Lawrence Ypil - A critical introduction*](https://www.poetry.sg/lawrence-ypil-intro)
