#### *What Ypilâ€™s poetry ultimately intuits is a kind of life, a persistence of its possibility nevertheless, in a world seemingly already predetermined in all directions. In other words: living, perhaps as a strange way to leave."* - [Christian Benitez](https://www.poetry.sg/lawrence-ypil-intro)
